      "This study aimed to determine how micro, small, medium, and large business industries in the City of Urdaneta implement proper hazardous waste management. Specifically, it sought to determine the enterprise classification of the respondents, their level of implementation of hazardous waste management in terms of transportation and storage, the significant difference in implementation when grouped according to enterprise classification, and the problems encountered in the process.",
      "Automobile industries listed in the Business Permit and Licensing Office (BPLO) of Urdaneta City that transport and store hazardous waste were the study's respondents. The researchers utilized a total population sampling method and employed frequency, percentage count, average weighted mean, and analysis of variance formulas to analyze the data. For the problems encountered, indicators with the lowest rate of performance were considered.",
      "The results revealed that most respondents, classified as micro-enterprises, often implement proper hazardous waste transportation with an average weighted mean (AWM) of 3.76. When it comes to storage, the respondents consistently implement proper hazardous waste storage practices, with an AWM of 4.65. However, they occasionally fail to prepare alternative routes to avoid populated and environmentally sensitive areas, and pay less attention to securing warning signs, transporters' IDs, and vehicle maintenance. Similarly, labeling of wastes and ventilation of storage facilities received less attention.",
      "The study concluded that business classification does not significantly affect the implementation of hazardous waste management practices. It recommended continuous performance improvement by automobile industries in Urdaneta City, including establishing a written mutual agreement with responsible agencies to strengthen joint accountability. It also suggested exploring qualitative methods to gain deeper insights and involving other groups such as NGOs and community stakeholders for broader environmental impact assessment. Finally, the researchers recommended that the local government consider the proposed plan to further enhance the implementation of hazardous waste management in the city.",

Thus, the control strategies in place during that year were effective in preventing an outbreak of the disease.",

Therefore, to further reduce dengue cases in Urdaneta City, intervention strategies focusing on these two areas must be strengthened.",
