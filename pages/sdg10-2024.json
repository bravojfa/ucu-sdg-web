          "In recent years, volunteerism has gained growing recognition as a powerful driver of positive social change across government, private organizations, and civil society, with volunteers contributing valuable skills, passion, and resources to address social, environmental, and economic challenges. Despite its acknowledged benefits, volunteerism often remains fragmented and underutilized within larger institutional frameworks. To bridge this gap, the project “Benchmarking Activity with Mainstreaming Volunteerism” was proposed to explore ways of integrating volunteerism more effectively into mainstream organizational strategies and operations. The initiative aimed to identify best practices, share successful models, and develop a roadmap for organizations to embed volunteerism within their core functions. Designed as a collaborative platform, the activity brought together diverse stakeholders—including government agencies, non-profits, private companies, and volunteer groups—to exchange experiences and insights. By engaging thought leaders and practitioners, the seminar promoted a deeper understanding of how volunteerism can align with broader organizational goals such as community development, capacity building, and sustainable impact."

          "The “Benchmarking Activity with Mainstreaming Volunteerism” significantly contributed to advancing several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), showcasing volunteerism as a powerful catalyst for sustainable development. The seminar highlighted volunteerism’s multifaceted role in promoting inclusive growth, empowering communities, and addressing global challenges outlined in the SDGs. It underscored how volunteerism supports SDG 1: No Poverty by engaging volunteers in frontline poverty alleviation efforts, improving access to basic services, education, and healthcare, thus helping marginalized communities overcome economic barriers. Similarly, volunteerism plays a crucial role in SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being through participation in public health initiatives such as vaccination drives, health education, mental health support, and emergency response, particularly in underserved areas. The activity also emphasized contributions to SDG 4: Quality Education, where volunteers bridge educational gaps by tutoring, mentoring, and leading programs in resource-limited communities, helping ensure equitable access to quality education. In advancing SDG 5: Gender Equality, volunteer-led initiatives address gender-based violence, advocate for women’s leadership, and support economic empowerment, challenging traditional norms and fostering equality. Volunteerism further promotes SDG 10: Reduced Inequality by empowering marginalized groups through community development and advocacy, supporting inclusive development models that prioritize equity. Lastly, the seminar reinforced SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals by facilitating collaboration among government, non-profits, private sectors, and volunteer groups, enabling resource sharing, scaling of successful initiatives, and collective progress toward the SDGs. Through these efforts, the activity demonstrated the vital role of mainstreaming volunteerism in driving sustainable and inclusive development worldwide."

              "The “Benchmarking Activity with Mainstreaming Volunteerism” seminar was a highly successful and impactful event that achieved its goals of fostering dialogue, sharing best practices, and promoting the integration of volunteerism into organizational frameworks. It offered valuable insights into effectively mainstreaming volunteerism within institutions to support sustainable development and social responsibility. A key strength was its comprehensive approach, combining theoretical knowledge with practical examples presented by a diverse range of speakers—from UCU leadership to PNVSCA personnel—providing a well-rounded perspective on implementation and scaling across different organizational contexts. By showcasing successful case studies alongside challenges faced, the seminar equipped participants with a clear, actionable roadmap for incorporating volunteerism into their practices. The event also fostered an interactive and engaging atmosphere, enhanced by multimedia presentations and the participation of various stakeholders including academics, non-profits, and corporate representatives, which reinforced the collaborative nature of volunteerism as a collective force for good. A strong emphasis on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) allowed attendees to connect volunteerism with broader social, economic, and environmental objectives, ensuring the seminar’s relevance to global development priorities. While overwhelmingly positive, feedback suggested that future seminars could benefit from more hands-on, interactive workshops for developing practical mainstreaming plans in smaller groups, as well as including additional case studies from diverse sectors like the private industry to broaden applicability. Logistically, the event was well-organized with a conducive venue, smooth program flow, and effective audiovisual support, making the overall experience informative and engaging for all participants."
