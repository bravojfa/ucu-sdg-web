            Poverty is a multifaceted issue that goes beyond mere lack of
            income; it encompasses various deprivations in health, education,
            and living standards. This goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty
            globally, ensuring that everyone has access to essential resources
            such as nutritious food, clean water, healthcare, and shelter.
            Urdaneta City University is committed to reducing poverty by
            offering scholarships and financial assistance to underprivileged
            students, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent talented
            individuals from pursuing higher education. Additionally, UCU
            engages in community outreach programs that provide educational
            workshops and resources to marginalized communities, empowering them
            with the knowledge and skills necessary for sustainable livelihoods.

            <p>
              The Center for Student Leadership and Development-Character and
              Values Formation Unit at Urdaneta City University launched an
              inspiring initiative entitled “UCUIANS CARE PROJECT,” with the
              theme "Caring Beyond Borders! Healthy Student, Healthy Mind."
              Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1 –
              No Poverty, this project seeks to promote the values of empathy,
              generosity, and community-mindedness by encouraging students to
              practice the timeless principle that caring is sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UCUIANS CARE PROJECT is designed to build awareness of the
              importance of sharing and compassion, fostering a campus
              environment where students are encouraged to think beyond
              themselves. Through this initiative, participants gain insight
              into the significance of generosity as a catalyst for personal and
              communal growth. Such acts of kindness help reinforce strong bonds
              within the university community, allowing individuals to relate to
              one another with understanding and respect.

              Urdaneta City University (UCU), through its Center for Student
              Leadership and Development (CSLD), continues to demonstrate its
              dedication to fostering an inclusive and equitable learning
              environment by offering financial assistance through its Tuition
              Discount Program. This initiative, which aligns with the United
              Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1 – No Poverty, is designed
              to provide essential support to students from economically
              disadvantaged families, helping reduce the barriers to education
              and empowering them to achieve their academic goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              In its ongoing effort to break the cycle of poverty through
              education, UCU understands the significant impact that financial
              constraints can have on a student’s academic journey. The Tuition
              Discount Program seeks to alleviate this burden by offering
              qualifying students reduced tuition fees, allowing them to focus
              on their studies and personal development without the constant
              worry of financial hardship.

            <p>
              The College of Arts and Sciences, under the leadership of Dean
              Princess Quintana, organized the EXTENSION ACTIVITY: CAS AGAPE for
              the students of Tiposu Elementary School on December 15, 2023.
              This event, which aimed to provide both material and emotional
              support, was made possible through the collective efforts of the
              college's faculty and students, who came together to uplift and
              bring joy to the children in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of objectives, the EXTENSION ACTIVITY: CAS AGAPE Program
              aimed to accomplish several key goals. Firstly, it focused on
              providing essential school supplies to underprivileged students,
              ensuring that they had the necessary tools for their education.
              This effort helped ease the financial burden on families who might
              otherwise struggle to afford these basic items. Secondly, the
              program sought to offer hope and encouragement to children from
              economically disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly during the
              holiday season.

              Urdaneta City University (UCU) demonstrates its commitment to
              supporting students and the local community in building
              financially and socially sustainable businesses through the Center
              for Student Leadership and Development (CSLD). One of the core
              mandates of the CSLD is to create economic and entrepreneurial
              programs designed to empower students with the practical knowledge
              and skills essential for navigating the world of business and
              trade.
            </p>
            <p>
              To fulfill this mandate, the CSLD has launched a pilot project for
              the Campus Student Organizations’ Trade Fair, an innovative
              approach aimed at encouraging campus-based entrepreneurial
              ventures. This fair provides accredited Campus Student

              Urdaneta City University (UCU) has officially launched a series of

              UCU, local schools, and barangays (villages). The program is part
              of the university's commitment to supporting the local
              government’s ongoing efforts to eradicate poverty and contribute
              to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of ending
              poverty in all its forms by 2030.

              The official launch of the program was marked by the signing of a
              Memorandum of Agreement led by UCU’s Extension Director, Jerry
              Dichoso, who played a pivotal role in forging partnerships between
              the university, local schools, and barangays. The event, held at
              the respective campuses of the partner schools and barangays, saw
              the signing of Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with several barangay

              Urdaneta City University (UCU) is taking significant steps to
              support sustainable business initiatives with the launch of a
              Livelihood Training Program on Mushroom Production, held on
              September 15, 2019. The program, organized by the Center for
              Community Development and Extension Services (CCDES) under the
              leadership of Dr. Mary Ruth Cinchez, aims to provide participants
              with the practical skills needed to start their own mushroom
              farming businesses while promoting sustainable agricultural
              practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              In partnership with the Provincial Agriculture Office, represented
              by Mdm. Concordia S. Lee, the training focused on both the
              technical aspects of mushroom production and the entrepreneurial
              strategies needed to establish a viable, long-term business. Mdm.
              Lee, who served as the lead trainer, guided the participants
              through key processes such as cultivation, harvesting, and the
              economic potential of mushroom farming as a sustainable business
              venture.
