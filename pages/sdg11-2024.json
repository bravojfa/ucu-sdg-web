          "Urdaneta City University (UCU) is dedicated to advancing its Environmental Management and Audit System (EMAS) and enhancing general campus services to boost institutional sustainability and meet international standards reflected in global university rankings like UI GreenMetric, WURI, and Times Higher Education (THE). This initiative prioritizes infrastructure readiness, efficient resource utilization, safety, accessibility, and the integration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into campus operations. By strengthening EMAS through systematic auditing, monitoring, and continuous improvement, UCU aims to elevate its environmental performance. Additionally, optimizing general services—such as facilities management, energy consumption, waste management, and support for students and faculty—is crucial in fostering a functional, inclusive, and environmentally responsible campus. These improvements directly contribute to ranking criteria, including sustainability, institutional support, and internationalization. Through this comprehensive effort, UCU not only enhances internal systems and accountability but also secures a competitive position in the global academic landscape, establishing itself as a leader in sustainable and effective university governance."

              "The Optimizing Engineering Management, Auxiliary, and General Services for Internationalization and Global University Rankings event at Urdaneta City University was a well-structured and impactful initiative that effectively advanced its goal of enhancing the university’s global standing. The comprehensive program featured sessions on key areas, including Engineering and Infrastructure Readiness, roles of different university sectors in rankings, and strategies for internationalization. Each session offered participants both foundational knowledge and actionable insights, encouraging them to think critically about how their departments and individual contributions could align with international standards. The training emphasized not only the technical aspects of rankings but also the integration of Sustainable Development Goals, underscoring the university’s commitment to sustainable progress. Notably, the discussions on financial and resource management and SDG integration provided a holistic view of how various sectors can collaborate to achieve long-term institutional success. Participant feedback highlighted a deeper understanding of the complexities of international rankings and a stronger sense of commitment to elevating UCU’s global presence. Overall, the program created a dynamic learning environment that inspired participants to champion the university’s goals of innovation, sustainability, and international excellence."

              "To further enhance the impact and sustainability of the Optimizing Engineering Management, Auxiliary, and General Services for Internationalization and Global University Rankings program at Urdaneta City University, several recommendations are proposed. First, it would be beneficial to extend the duration of key sessions—especially those on Engineering and Infrastructure Readiness and Sustainable Development Goal integration—to allow participants to explore topics in greater depth and engage in more hands-on activities. Providing pre-event reading materials or guidelines on international rankings and best practices could help participants arrive better prepared and more engaged. Additionally, incorporating more practical case studies, particularly those relevant to the university’s current initiatives, would make the discussions more grounded and actionable. To support the continuity of learning, the program could introduce follow-up workshops or online forums where participants can share progress and exchange ideas on implementing strategies learned during the event. Establishing a mentorship component involving experienced university leaders or external experts in internationalization could further strengthen participants’ skills and confidence. Lastly, future iterations could include evaluation mechanisms such as pre- and post-event surveys or mini-projects that track participants’ application of knowledge and contributions to the university’s global ranking efforts. These recommendations would help solidify the program’s role in driving sustainable internationalization and institutional excellence."
