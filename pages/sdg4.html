              Urdaneta City University (UCU) fourth-year psychology students led
              an impactful virtual event titled “Heal the Unseen Battle:
              Reducing the Stigma and Psychological Misconceptions.” The
              day-long webinar, organized by students from UCU’s College of
              Human Sciences, Department of Psychology, aimed to address mental
              health misconceptions and reduce the stigma surrounding
              psychological issues. Streamed on Google Meet and Facebook Live,
              the event was attended by UCU students, employees, and
              participants from other universities, all united by a shared
              commitment to learning more about mental wellness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The webinar addressed key aspects of mental health awareness,
              including the importance of dispelling common myths that
              contribute to misunderstanding and stigma. Expert speakers tackled
              pervasive misconceptions about mental health, providing
              participants with accurate information about mental illness,
              emotional resilience, and stress management. Discussions also
              highlighted how stigma often prevents individuals from seeking
              help, with speakers encouraging a community-wide approach to
              foster support and understanding around mental health concerns.
              Psychology students and faculty facilitated open conversations,
              creating a safe and respectful environment for attendees to share
              their own experiences and concerns.

              each focusing on the development of vital life skills. The College
              of Community Development and Extension Services (CCDES) conducted

              learning experiences, particularly in the areas of self-awareness
              and human relations. A Client Needs Assessment was also carried
              out to ensure that future activities would continue to meet the
              evolving needs of the participants.

              Urdaneta City, Philippines – The Urdaneta City University-Center
              for Training and Professional Development (UCU-CTPD) recently
              concluded a successful webinar titled “Antimicrobial Stewardship
              in Hospital Setting.” The event, held on April 23, 2023, via Zoom,
              attracted a significant number of registered pharmacists.
            </p>
            <p>
              The webinar featured an insightful presentation by Mr. Mark Clyde
              D. Daoana, PharmD, RPh, who shared his expertise on best practices
              in antimicrobial stewardship. The session delved into the critical
              role of pharmacists in promoting the appropriate use of
              antibiotics, thereby mitigating the growing threat of
              antimicrobial resistance.
