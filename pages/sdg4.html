                Urdaneta City University (UCU) fourth-year psychology students
                led an impactful virtual event titled “Heal the Unseen Battle:
                Reducing the Stigma and Psychological Misconceptions.” The
                day-long webinar, organized by students from UCU’s College of
                Human Sciences, Department of Psychology, aimed to address
                mental health misconceptions and reduce the stigma surrounding
                psychological issues. Streamed on Google Meet and Facebook Live,
                the event was attended by UCU students, employees, and
                participants from other universities, all united by a shared
                commitment to learning more about mental wellness.
              </p>
              <p>
                The webinar addressed key aspects of mental health awareness,
                including the importance of dispelling common myths that
                contribute to misunderstanding and stigma. Expert speakers
                tackled pervasive misconceptions about mental health, providing
                participants with accurate information about mental illness,
                emotional resilience, and stress management. Discussions also
                highlighted how stigma often prevents individuals from seeking
                help, with speakers encouraging a community-wide approach to
                foster support and understanding around mental health concerns.
                Psychology students and faculty facilitated open conversations,
                creating a safe and respectful environment for attendees to
                share their own experiences and concerns.

                community service awareness and self-growth. The project, which
                continues to evolve through weekly learning sessions, has been a
                collaborative effort involving various colleges and departments,
                each contributing unique activities designed to empower youth

              <p>
                One of the key components of the PTO project is the series of
                extension activities and workshops led by different departments,
                each focusing on the development of vital life skills. The
                College of Community Development and Extension Services (CCDES)
                conducted sessions that encouraged beneficiaries to reflect on
                their learning experiences, particularly in the areas of
                self-awareness and human relations. A Client Needs Assessment
                was also carried out to ensure that future activities would
                continue to meet the evolving needs of the participants.

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                We should adapt Adamson University’s outcome-based curriculum
                audit process, tailoring its performance indicators to our
                program objectives and accreditation requirements. Establishing
                a cross-functional task force will ensure coherent

              <h3>General Assessment</h3>
              <p>
                Urdaneta City University's participation in the ADESSA LRA 2024
                was a timely and strategic move that reflects its proactive
                approach to institutional modernization. The activity provided
                valuable insights into the current trends in educational
                technology and system integration, equipping university
                representatives with the knowledge needed to upgrade existing
                processes and improve service delivery. The exposure to various
                digital solutions and system providers also broadened UCU's
                perspective on how to better manage academic and administrative
                data in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assembly served as an excellent platform for professional
                development, particularly for the university’s IT and
                administrative staff, who play critical roles in implementing
                digital tools and managing institutional systems. The
                collaborative and solution-oriented nature of the event fostered
                meaningful discussions and practical learning, allowing
                participants to engage with experts, raise concerns, and seek
                advice on challenges they face within their respective
                institutions. This exchange of ideas added depth and value to
                the experience, going beyond mere product demonstrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the activity can be considered highly successful and
                impactful. It reinforced UCU’s commitment to data accuracy,
                operational efficiency, and digital transformation in higher
                education. The university’s engagement in such assemblies
                ensures that it remains responsive to technological advancements
                and capable of sustaining innovations that benefit its students,

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                To maximize the long-term benefits of participating in the
                ADESSA LRA, it is recommended that Urdaneta City University form
                a dedicated digital transformation task force responsible for
                assessing, planning, and implementing technology solutions
                discussed during the assembly. This group should evaluate which
                systems are most compatible with UCU’s current infrastructure,
                pilot new technologies, and lead campus-wide IT training to
                ensure smooth integration. Institutionalizing follow-through
                efforts after such events will ensure that learnings are
                translated into actionable improvements, rather than remaining
                theoretical insights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the university should consider organizing internal
                echo sessions or knowledge-sharing forums, where attendees of
                the ADESSA LRA can present key takeaways and proposed
                innovations to other departments. This approach will not only
                expand the reach of the knowledge gained but will also foster a
                culture of collaboration and continuous learning across the
                university. Moving forward, regular participation in similar
                assemblies and maintaining strong partnerships with technology
                providers will be crucial for keeping UCU at the forefront of
                education technology and institutional efficiency.

              The ATQA webinar significantly contributes to the achievement of
              the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG
              4: Quality Education. By focusing on improving teacher

              during the webinar emphasized the importance of pedagogical
              innovation, cultural responsiveness, and student-centered
              approaches. In addition, the event aligns with SDG 17:
              Partnerships for the Goals, by fostering collaboration and
              knowledge exchange among educators, institutions, and
              policy-makers across different countries. This collective effort
              strengthens the regional education ecosystem and builds a
              foundation for long-term, sustainable improvements in teaching and

            <h3>Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
            <p>
              This career orientation activity contributes significantly to SDG
              4: Quality Education by ensuring that students not only receive
              academic instruction but also gain access to relevant career
              guidance and employability skills. By integrating career readiness
              programs into the university experience, the activity helps bridge
              the gap between education and employment, enhancing the overall
              quality and relevance of higher education. It promotes lifelong
              learning and prepares students to become productive members of
              society.

            <p>
              The event also supports SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth by

              the workforce with confidence and competence. Through sessions on
              job market trends, resume writing, and interview preparation, the

              industries, and alumni. These partnerships enhance the learning
              experience and provide students with a support network that
              extends beyond graduation. By working together to prepare the next
              generation of professionals, all stakeholders contribute to the
              collective goal of building a more educated, skilled, and
              sustainable workforce ready to address the global challenges of

              <h3>General Assessment</h3>
              <p>
                The Career Orientation for 2024 Graduating Students proved to be
                a well-organized and impactful initiative by Urdaneta City
                University. The program successfully addressed the needs of
                graduating students by providing them with essential knowledge
                and practical tools for transitioning into the workforce. The
                combination of expert talks, alumni sharing, and interactive
                workshops created a well-rounded learning environment. Students
                were able to gain a clearer understanding of the job market,
                industry expectations, and how to position themselves
                effectively for employment.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the strongest aspects of the orientation was its focus on
                engagement and real-world relevance. The presence of
                professionals from different industries and successful alumni
                made the sessions more relatable and credible. Resume-building
                and interview workshops were particularly helpful, as they
                offered hands-on experience and immediate feedback. The
                networking opportunities allowed students to establish
                connections that could potentially lead to job or internship
                offers, further enhancing the event's value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the activity met its objectives and was well-received
                by the student participants. It contributed not only to their
                career readiness but also to their personal growth and
                confidence. The orientation reaffirmed the university’s
                commitment to producing graduates who are not only academically
                competent but also prepared for the professional world. It is
                recommended that this activity be continued and expanded in
                future years to include follow-up sessions and more industry
                partnerships to further support students' career development.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                To further enhance the impact of the career orientation program,
                it is recommended that follow-up sessions or career clinics be
                organized throughout the academic year. These sessions can
                provide more in-depth training on job application processes,
                such as mock interviews, portfolio development, and job-hunting
                strategies tailored to specific fields. Additionally,
                integrating digital tools like LinkedIn profile building and
                online job platforms into the orientation can better prepare
                students for the modern job market. Offering one-on-one
                consultations with career counselors would also allow for
                personalized guidance based on individual goals and needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is also recommended to strengthen partnerships with local
                industries, companies, and alumni networks to expand
                opportunities for internships, mentorships, and on-the-spot job
                offers. Inviting a more diverse set of speakers from various
                career paths — including entrepreneurship, public service, and
                international employment — can help students explore a wider
                range of career options. Finally, gathering formal feedback from
                participants after the event can provide valuable insights that
                will help organizers refine the program for future graduating
                batches.

                Early stakeholder consultations reveal strong enthusiasm.
                Student surveys show 82 % interest in Japan-based internships
                and 76 % in local project collaborations. Faculty view the
                boot-camp series as a critical pathway to keep syllabi current
                with fast-moving tech trends. Baseline metrics—internship
                placements, joint publications, and pilot-project adoption
                rates—have been embedded in the MoA’s monitoring matrix. Both
                parties agreed on quarterly reviews to track progress and
                recalibrate resources. This structured governance model reduces
                execution risk and clarifies accountability. Potential
                challenges include aligning academic calendars with corporate
                project timelines and ensuring language readiness for
                Japan-bound interns. Mitigation strategies, such as flexible
                credit mapping and a pre-departure Japanese language module,
                were agreed upon during the signing ceremony, demonstrating
                proactive risk management.

                Prioritize the rapid rollout of the language-and-culture
                orientation program so the first internship cohort is fully
                prepared; integrating it as a one-unit elective or co-curricular
                requirement will institutionalize participation without
                overloading students. Create a joint innovation fund seeded by
                both parties to support student prototypes that emerge from the
                boot camps and capstone collaborations. Micro-grants of USD
                1,000–2,000 per project will foster agile experimentation,
                deepen engagement, and generate tangible outputs that underscore

                with its diverse offerings and daily live sessions, received
                positive feedback for its capacity to supplement traditional
                learning with practical, career-oriented knowledge. The one-year
                free access to ReSkills is seen as a significant opportunity,
                especially for students from resource-limited areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participants appreciated the globally accredited certification
                system that accompanies course completion, giving them a
                competitive advantage in job applications, internships, or
                entrepreneurial ventures. The digital-first approach was
                especially well-suited to current educational trends that favor
                flexibility, interactivity, and self-paced learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the activity has made a strong initial impact. With
                continued promotion and user support, it holds the potential to
                transform how students and educators engage with skill-based
                learning. The commitment to innovation, accessibility, and
                relevance in education makes this initiative a valuable asset in
                our academic landscape.

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                To sustain the momentum of this initiative, it is recommended
                that the university establish a ReSkills Support and Monitoring
                Team tasked with promoting platform usage, tracking student
                progress, and resolving technical or academic concerns. Faculty
                should also be encouraged to integrate ReSkills classes into
                their syllabi where appropriate, reinforcing learning outcomes
                through applied, industry-relevant content.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, a series of follow-up webinars or user experience
                sharing sessions should be held to maintain engagement and help
                learners reflect on their growth. By embedding this platform
                into the fabric of our academic support system, the university
                can ensure that the full benefits of the Global Reskilling
                Movement are realized across all departments and stakeholders.

          <h1>IEF OMAN 2024</h1>

          <section>
            <p>
              In May 2024, Urdaneta City University participated in the
              International Education Fair (IEF) Oman 2024, a prestigious event
              that brought together educational institutions, global
              stakeholders, and prospective students from various countries.
              This international fair served as a platform for promoting
              academic exchange, cross-border partnerships, and higher education
              opportunities. UCU’s participation highlighted its commitment to
              internationalization and its desire to expand its global reach
              through strategic collaborations. Through IEF Oman 2024, UCU
              showcased its academic programs, research initiatives, and
              institutional values to a diverse international audience.

            <p>
              The event provided an avenue for the university to connect with
              educational agencies, student recruiters, and potential partner
              institutions across the Middle East and beyond. It also allowed
              UCU to explore opportunities for international student enrollment,
              research collaboration, and faculty development programs. This
              initiative aligns with UCU’s vision of becoming a globally
              recognized institution of higher learning. By engaging in global
              education fairs like IEF Oman, UCU strengthens its identity as an
              inclusive, forward-looking university that values cross-cultural
              exchange and international cooperation in education and research.

            <h3>Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
            <p>
              Urdaneta City University’s participation in the IEF Oman 2024
              contributes significantly to several Sustainable Development Goals
              (SDGs), particularly SDG 4: Quality Education and SDG 17:
              Partnerships for the Goals. By presenting its academic offerings
              and engaging with international institutions, UCU promotes access
              to inclusive and equitable quality education while enhancing
              global learning opportunities. This fosters academic exchange,
              cultural understanding, and mutual learning, which are essential
              elements of a globally relevant and inclusive education system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the activity supports SDG 17 by building strong
              international partnerships that encourage cooperation in research,
              faculty development, and student mobility. These cross-border
              collaborations help strengthen institutional capacity, broaden
              educational access, and contribute to the shared global goal of
              sustainable, inclusive development in higher education. The event
              also indirectly aligns with SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic
              Growth, by creating pathways for international education that can
              lead to better employment opportunities for graduates, both
              locally and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
              By participating in global education platforms such as IEF Oman,
              UCU reinforces its commitment to integrating global standards into
              its academic framework and promoting sustainability, equity, and
              innovation in education—values that are foundational to the SDG
              framework.

              <h3>General Assessment</h3>
              <p>
                Urdaneta City University's participation in the IEF Oman 2024
                was a strategic and impactful initiative that successfully
                aligned with its goals of internationalization and global
                academic engagement. The event provided a platform for the
                university to showcase its programs, highlight its institutional
                achievements, and explore international partnerships. UCU made a
                positive impression among prospective students and partner
                institutions, positioning itself as a competitive and globally
                relevant academic institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The activity was also a valuable learning experience for the
                university's delegation, as it exposed them to emerging global
                trends in education, student mobility, and international
                recruitment. The exchange of ideas with fellow participants from
                around the world enriched UCU's understanding of how it can
                further enhance its offerings and adapt to the evolving demands
                of the global education market. The fair reinforced the
                importance of visibility, branding, and relationship-building in
                the international academic landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the university’s involvement in IEF Oman 2024 can be
                considered a success. It not only advanced UCU’s international
                presence but also opened new doors for academic collaboration
                and innovation. The connections made during the event are
                expected to lead to future opportunities for student exchange,
                joint research, and faculty development, thereby strengthening
                UCU’s role in the global education community.

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>
                To maximize the long-term benefits of participating in
                international fairs like IEF Oman, it is recommended that
                Urdaneta City University develop a follow-up strategy to nurture
                the connections and inquiries made during the event. This
                includes maintaining communication with interested students and
                potential partner institutions through personalized emails,
                virtual consultations, and digital brochures. Creating a
                dedicated internationalization team or office that handles these
                interactions can help sustain engagement, increase the
                likelihood of partnership agreements, and support international
                student admissions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the university should consider investing in more
                visible and interactive promotional materials, such as videos,
                virtual campus tours, and multilingual brochures, to better
                cater to diverse international audiences. Including testimonials
                from international students and highlighting UCU’s achievements
                in global rankings or research can also improve its appeal.
                Future participation in global events should be aligned with a
                comprehensive internationalization plan, ensuring that each
                engagement contributes to the broader goal of making UCU a
                globally recognized and collaborative institution.
