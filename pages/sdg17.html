          Achieving the SDGs requires collaboration across all sectors. This
          goal emphasizes the importance of partnerships among governments,
          civil society, and the private sector to accelerate progress towards
          sustainable development. Urdaneta City University builds partnerships
          with local and international organizations to share knowledge,
          resources, and best practices. Collaborating on research projects and
          community initiatives enhances UCU’s contributions to achieving the
          SDGs and promotes a collective effort towards a sustainable future.
