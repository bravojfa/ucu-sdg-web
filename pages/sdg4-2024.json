The National Service Training Program (NSTP) in the Philippines, as a civic education initiative, presents a valuable opportunity to integrate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into student learning. In response, Urdaneta City University proposes the project HEROE: Harnessing Engagement and Resilience through Online Exchange. Designed to enhance NSTP delivery, HEROE incorporates Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) methodologies that connect students with international peers through virtual exchanges. This approach deepens students' understanding of global issues such as poverty, inequality, climate action, peacebuilding, and community resilience—key themes within the SDGs. By participating in structured COIL experiences, NSTP instructors and students will co-create culturally informed solutions and develop civic projects with global relevance. This transformative initiative not only enriches the NSTP curriculum but also positions UCU as a forward-looking institution dedicated to inclusive, sustainable, and globally engaged education."

Establishing ongoing communication with the Japanese partner school—through regular video exchanges or a pen-pal program—can deepen cross-cultural relationships beyond a single event. Expanding the program’s reach by involving more beneficiaries or replicating it in other public schools is also recommended, potentially supported by partnerships with local government units and community organizations. Involving teachers and parents through orientations or feedback sessions can reinforce lessons learned and create a more supportive environment for the pupils. Developing a basic monitoring and evaluation tool, such as surveys or interviews, will help gather participant feedback to assess effectiveness and guide future improvements. Enhancing the health component by collaborating further with UCU’s health-related departments can provide ongoing guidance on nutrition and hygiene beyond the event. Lastly, documenting the program through photos, testimonials, and success stories will support promotion, knowledge sharing, and inspire similar initiatives within and beyond the university."

The workshop highlighted the essential role of informed and empowered youth in promoting equality, reinforcing democratic values, and addressing the social challenges outlined in the SDGs. It notably supported SDG 4: Quality Education by equipping youth leaders with knowledge of fundamental rights and legal frameworks, fostering inclusive, equitable, and rights-based education, and empowering participants to advocate for human rights within their communities, thereby enhancing access to knowledge and civic awareness. In addressing SDG 5: Gender Equality, the workshop engaged youth leaders in discussions on gender-based discrimination, equal participation, and women’s empowerment, encouraging both male and female participants to challenge harmful norms and promote safety, inclusion, and equal opportunity. It contributed to SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities by empowering marginalized youth to actively engage in civic and decision-making processes, creating a safe space for diverse voices and promoting equitable leadership opportunities to help lessen social and economic disparities. Relating to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, the training fostered a culture of peace, respect for the rule of law, and active civic participation, deepening participants’ understanding of justice systems, accountability, and the role of citizens in democratic governance through real-life human rights cases. Finally, the workshop reinforced SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals by cultivating collaboration among the Commission on Human Rights, Urdaneta City University, and various youth organizations, thereby strengthening collective capacity to advocate for human rights, mobilize resources, and implement impactful community-based initiatives."

By combining foundational concepts with practical, real-world applications, the workshop empowered youth leaders to promote equality, uphold democratic values, and address critical social issues within their communities. Resource speakers from the Commission on Human Rights – Region I provided expert insights grounded in actual cases, while interactive sessions enabled participants to translate theory into actionable strategies, creating a clear roadmap for integrating human rights advocacy into youth-led initiatives. The event also fostered an engaging and inclusive environment, bringing together diverse participants—from student organizations, SK officials, youth volunteers, to community leaders—which enriched discussions and reinforced the shared responsibility of protecting human rights across sectors. Strongly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially those on education, equality, and institutional strength, the workshop encouraged participants to reflect on how human rights principles intersect with sustainable development and apply these insights in local advocacy efforts. Despite its success, suggestions for improvement included extending the duration for deeper exploration of complex topics, incorporating more localized case studies for context-specific learning, and integrating discussions on digital rights and online advocacy, reflecting the growing role of technology in human rights issues. Logistically, the event was well-organized, with a supportive venue setup, smooth transitions, and effective audiovisual support, making the workshop both informative and engaging for all attendees."
