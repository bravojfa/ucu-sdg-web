          "Urdaneta City University (UCU) has a long-standing mandate to produce graduates who are not only employable but also capable of catalyzing local economic growth. Cooperatives, with their community-owned business model, offer a natural platform for inclusive development, yet the Region 1 cooperative sector still grapples with limited technical expertise and innovation. The Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) is the national body tasked with regulating and nurturing cooperatives. By formalizing a Memorandum of Agreement, UCU gains direct access to CDA’s policy guidance, training resources, and field networks, while CDA secures an academic partner to embed cooperative education in teacher preparation, business programs, and community-extension work."

              "Initial stakeholder meetings reveal strong enthusiasm: 14 regional cooperatives have signaled intent to participate in training, and two local government units have pledged venue and logistics support. Baseline data collected by UCU’s Research Office show that only 38 % of surveyed cooperatives keep audited financial statements and 22 % use any form of digital bookkeeping. These gaps underscore the relevance of the planned workshops and certificate program. Key risks include securing sustained funding for outreach activities and managing faculty workload. However, the creation of a joint steering committee and an earmarked seed budget from both institutions mitigates these concerns and positions the MoA for early wins."

              "Institutionalize a revolving fund—sourced from fair proceeds and modest cooperative membership fees—to underwrite annual training and research grants. This will reduce dependence on one-off project funds and ensure continuity. Pair quantitative metrics (e.g., cooperative survival rates, job creation) with qualitative feedback from members to evaluate impact each year. A balanced scorecard will guide iterative improvements, prevent mission drift, and keep the partnership aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals."

It demonstrated strong institutional commitment to supporting students beyond academic instruction, by offering them access to job placement services and practical career development resources.",

This collaboration brought credibility, resources, and expertise to the university’s employment facilitation efforts. The presence of labor officials during the launch emphasized the importance of cross-sectoral cooperation in addressing youth unemployment. Additionally, the creation of a dedicated office ensures sustainability and continuity in delivering employment support services to students and alumni.",

Additionally, the office should implement digital platforms for job postings, virtual career counseling, and online application systems to make services more accessible to students and alumni.",
              "Another key recommendation is to strengthen engagement with external partners, including local businesses, government agencies, and alumni networks. Building strong relationships with employers can open doors for internships, on-the-job training, and employment opportunities. The office should also consider organizing career development seminars and workshops throughout the academic year, not only for graduating students but also for undergraduates, to build early awareness and preparation for future employment. Regular monitoring and feedback mechanisms should be established to evaluate the effectiveness of services and make continuous improvements."
