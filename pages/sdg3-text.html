          Health is a fundamental human right, yet many individuals lack access
          to essential healthcare services. This goal aims to reduce maternal
          and child mortality, combat communicable diseases, and promote mental
          health awareness. It advocates for universal access to quality
          healthcare services, ensuring that all individuals can lead healthy
          lives. Urdaneta City University prioritizes the health and well-being
          of its students by providing comprehensive mental health services,
          including counseling and wellness programs. The University organizes
          health awareness campaigns and workshops that promote physical fitness
          and mental resilience, fostering a supportive environment for overall
          well-being.

              Urdaneta City, Philippines â€” In a meaningful initiative aimed at
              enhancing physical education in local schools, the College of
              Teacher Education at Urdaneta City University (UCU) has donated
              research- based sports equipment to various public schools across
              Pangasinan. Developed by UCU students as part of their research
              projects, the equipment aims to support sports programs in
              underserved communities, promoting fitness, teamwork, and skill
              development among students.
            </p>

            <h3>A Research-Driven Initiative to Support Local Education</h3>

            <p>
              The donation is part of UCU's broader commitment to applying
              research for community development, showcasing how student-led
              projects can directly benefit society. The College of Teacher
              Education collaborated with its students to design and create
              sports equipment tailored to the needs of local schools, aligning
              with their research findings on accessible, practical, and safe
              sports gear for young athletes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dr. Ryan delos Reyes, Dean of the College of Teacher Education,
              highlighted the significance of the initiative, stating, "This
              project not only allows our students to apply their research in a
              meaningful way but also addresses a genuine need in the community.
              By donating this equipment, we hope to inspire the next generation
              to embrace physical education and lead healthier lives."
            </p>

            <h3>Empowering Public Schools with Quality Sports Resources</h3>

            <p>
              Public schools in many regions, including Pangasinan, often face
              budget constraints that limit their ability to invest in quality
              sports equipment. UCU's donation helps bridge this gap, providing
              schools with gear that supports various sports activities, from
              basketball to track and field. Each piece of equipment was
              thoughtfully crafted by UCU students, based on research focused on
              durability, safety, and accessibility for young users.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the schools receiving the donation, [School Name] in
              [Location], expressed gratitude for the much-needed resources.
              "These sports items are a great addition to our physical education
              program," said [Principal's Name], principal of [School Name].
              "Thanks to UCU and its students, we can now offer better
              facilities for our students, which will help them develop athletic
              skills and foster a spirit of sportsmanship."
            </p>

            <h3>Students Making an Impact Through Research</h3>

            <p>
              The project also reflects UCU's commitment to hands-on learning,
              encouraging students to engage in research that has real-world
              applications. For the student-researchers involved, the experience
              offered a chance to see their work directly benefit their
              community, reinforcing the importance of academic efforts that
              extend beyond the classroom.
            </p>

            <p>
              One student, [Student's Name], who participated in designing the
              equipment, shared, "It's fulfilling to know that our research is
              making a difference. We were able to apply what we learned to
              create sports equipment that can help other students in public
              schools discover their potential in sports."
            </p>

            <h3>UCU's Dedication to Community Service and Education</h3>

            <p>
              UCU's College of Teacher Education plans to continue supporting
              local schools through future projects that integrate research with
              community service. This initiative aligns with UCU's mission to
              serve as an educational institution that not only nurtures student
              learning but also actively contributes to the development of the
              wider community.
            </p>

            <p>
              "By donating these resources, we are investing in the future of
              young students and in the improvement of public education in
              Pangasinan," Dr. delos reyes added. "Our aim is to encourage other
              institutions and individuals to support local schools and create
              similar projects that benefit the community."
            </p>

            <h3>Looking Forward: More Collaborations with Local Schools</h3>

            <p>
              Following the success of this donation, UCU aims to explore
              additional collaborations with public schools in Pangasinan,
              especially in areas that would benefit from innovative,
              research-based resources. The university envisions these
              partnerships as a way to promote not only physical fitness but
              also the importance of applying research to meet the needs of the
              community.
            </p>

            <p>
              As UCU continues to champion research with a community focus, the
              College of Teacher Education is proud to lead initiatives that
              enhance educational experiences for students across Pangasinan.
              This donation is a testament to UCU's commitment to transforming
              research into practical, impactful contributions that uplift and
              inspire local communities.

          UCU Midwifery Program Champions Gender and Society Class on Sexual and
          Reproductive Health-Care Services
        </h1>

          <section class="text">
            <p>
              In a progressive step towards inclusive and comprehensive
              education on sexual and reproductive health, the Midwifery Program
              of Urdaneta City University (UCU) has introduced a dynamic course
              on Gender and Society that equips students with essential
              knowledge on gender equality, sexual health, and reproductive
              rights. This initiative, a first of its kind in the region, seeks
              to empower future midwives with skills and insights to provide
              more empathetic and informed health care to diverse communities.
            </p>

            <p>
              The course covers a wide array of critical topics, including
              family planning, maternal health, sexually transmitted infections
              (STIs), and the importance of accessible reproductive health
              services. The UCU Midwifery Program recognizes that midwives often
              serve as the primary touchpoint for reproductive health in many
              communities, making it essential for students to have a nuanced
              understanding of gender sensitivities and patient-centered care.
            </p>

            <p>
              "The Gender and Society course is essential in molding
              compassionate and well-informed health care providers," one of the
              course facilitators. "By focusing on the intersections of gender,
              culture, and health, our students are learning to approach patient
              care with respect for individual identities and needs."
            </p>

            <p>
              The initiative aligns with the objectives of the Safe Spaces Act
              (RA 11313) and the broader goals of the Sustainable Development
              Goals (SDG), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and
              SDG 5 (Gender Equality). Students explore the impact of social and
              cultural factors on reproductive health choices and discuss
              strategies for overcoming barriers to health care access.
            </p>

            <p>
              UCU's efforts have garnered praise from local health organizations
              and community leaders. "This program not only improves the
              education of our future midwives but also contributes to the
              overall health literacy and empowerment of our communities,".
            </p>

            <p>
              With this innovative program, UCU continues to lead in advancing
              educational practices that prioritize human rights and health
              equity, preparing its students to make a positive impact in health
              care and beyond.

              health support program aimed at providing essential resources and
              assistance to both students and staff members. The initiative
              comes as part of the university's ongoing efforts to address the
              growing importance of mental well-being within academic
              environments. UCU's administration highlighted the significance of
              supporting mental health amidst the pressures of academic life,

              private sessions with professional counselors through an easy-
              to-use online platform. UCU has also committed to providing mental
              health services at no additional cost to students and employees,
              ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent anyone from
              seeking help.

              The mental health support initiative is just one of many steps UCU
              is taking to ensure that students and staff can succeed in both
