              "To further strengthen the university’s performance in global impact rankings and advance its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is essential to establish an SDG Monitoring Committee responsible for collecting, validating, and reporting relevant data. This committee will ensure accuracy and consistency in data management while serving as a central hub for SDG-related information. Additionally, conducting internal workshops for both academic and administrative units will be crucial to disseminate the knowledge gained from training sessions and to align efforts across the entire university. Developing a comprehensive SDG-aligned strategic plan that incorporates measurable indicators will provide a clear roadmap for impact ranking participation and institutional sustainability goals. Enhancing inter-departmental coordination is also necessary to facilitate comprehensive and accurate data submission, fostering collaboration and shared responsibility. Finally, investing in digital tools tailored to support data management and reporting will enable the university to efficiently track progress and meet international ranking standards, ensuring a more effective and transparent approach to sustainability performance."
