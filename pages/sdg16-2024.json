              "To further enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of the BRILGE program, several recommendations are suggested. First, increasing the frequency of the legal aid caravan—such as hosting it quarterly or semi-annually—would allow for continuous support and follow-up on legal concerns. Expanding the scope of services to include more specialized areas, such as family law, labor rights, and cybercrime, could also meet a broader range of legal needs within the university community. It is also recommended to implement a confidential pre-registration system for consultations to manage time effectively and ensure privacy. Additionally, distributing printed or digital legal information materials (e.g., brochures or FAQs) during the event would reinforce learning beyond the sessions. Lastly, involving law students in organizing and assisting during the event could provide valuable experiential learning opportunities while helping scale the program’s reach. These improvements would help BRILGE make a deeper, long-term impact on legal empowerment across the university."
