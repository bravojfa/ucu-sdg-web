          Poverty is a multifaceted issue that goes beyond mere lack of income;
          it encompasses various deprivations in health, education, and living
          standards. This goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty globally,
          ensuring that everyone has access to essential resources such as
          nutritious food, clean water, healthcare, and shelter. Urdaneta City
          University is committed to reducing poverty by offering scholarships
          and financial assistance to underprivileged students, ensuring that
          financial barriers do not prevent talented individuals from pursuing
          higher education. Additionally, UCU engages in community outreach
          programs that provide educational workshops and resources to
          marginalized communities, empowering them with the knowledge and
          skills necessary for sustainable livelihoods.

              The Center for Student Leadership and Development-Character and
              Values Formation Unit at Urdaneta City University launched an
              inspiring initiative entitled "UCUIANS CARE PROJECT," with the
              theme "Caring Beyond Borders! Healthy Student, Healthy Mind."
              Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1 —
              No Poverty, this project seeks to promote the values of empathy,
              generosity, and community-mindedness by encouraging students to
              practice the timeless principle that caring is sharing. The
              UCUIANS CARE PROJECT is designed to build awareness of the
              importance of sharing and compassion, fostering a campus
              environment where students are encouraged to think beyond
              themselves. Through this initiative, participants gain insight
              into the significance of generosity as a catalyst for personal and
              communal growth. Such acts of kindness help reinforce strong bonds
              within the university community, allowing individuals to relate to
              one another with understanding and respect.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rooted in the Filipino tradition of Bayanihan, or communal unity,
              the project embodies the collective spirit that uplifts the less
              fortunate. This solidarity, preserved in our society's moral
              fabric, reminds students of their ability and responsibility to
              make a difference. The first implementation of the program took
              place on August 13, 2023, at the CSLD Square, where fifty student
              beneficiaries from various colleges within the university gathered
              to participate in activities centered around support, empowerment,
              and wellness. By engaging in this initiative, students take their
              first steps toward building a more compassionate, equitable
              future—one where everyone thrives, no matter their background or
              circumstances.

              Urdaneta City University (UCU), through its Center for Student
              Leadership and Development (CSLD), continues to demonstrate its
              dedication to fostering an inclusive and equitable learning
              environment by offering financial assistance through its Tuition
              Discount Program. This initiative, which aligns with the United
              Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1 No Poverty, is designed to
              provide essential support to students from economically
              disadvantaged families, helping reduce the barriers to education
              and empowering them to achieve their academic goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              In its ongoing effort to break the cycle of poverty through
              education, UCU understands the significant impact that financial
              constraints can have on a student's academic journey. The Tuition
              Discount Program seeks to alleviate this burden by offering
              qualifying students reduced tuition fees, allowing them to focus
              on their studies and personal development without the constant
              worry of financial hardship.
            </p>

            <p>
              The program aims to create an inclusive and supportive learning
              environment where students can thrive, regardless of their
              socio-economic background. By offering this assistance, UCU
              strengthens its mission of making quality education accessible to
              all, particularly those who need it the most.
            </p>

            <p>
              In line with the university's broader vision, this initiative not
              only seeks to address immediate financial concerns but also plays
              a crucial role in shaping a more compassionate and empowered
              student community. UCU recognizes that education is a key factor
              in creating opportunities and breaking down barriers for those
              from low-income families, and through the Tuition Discount
              Program, the university is helping pave the way for a brighter
              future for its students.
            </p>

            <p>
              By prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility, Urdaneta City
              University is taking a significant step toward addressing one of
              the most pressing challenges facing the global community today:
              poverty. With its ongoing support for financially disadvantaged
              students, UCU is contributing to the creation of a more equitable
              society where education serves as a powerful tool for social
              mobility and positive change.

              The College of Arts and Sciences, under the leadership of Dean
              Princess Quintana, organized the EXTENSION ACTIVITY: CAS AGAPE for
              the students of Tiposu Elementary School on December 15, 2023.
              This event, which aimed to provide both material and emotional
              support, was made possible through the collective efforts of the
              college's faculty and students, who came together to uplift and
              bring joy to the children in the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of objectives, the EXTENSION ACTIVITY: CAS AGAPE Program
              aimed to accomplish several key goals. Firstly, it focused on
              providing essential school supplies to underprivileged students,
              ensuring that they had the necessary tools for their education.
              This effort helped ease the financial burden on families who might
              otherwise struggle to afford these basic items. Secondly, the
              program sought to offer hope and encouragement to children from
              economically disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly during the
              holiday season. By providing gifts and support, it aimed to lift
              their spirits and remind them that they are valued. Finally, the
              initiative sought to instill a sense of social responsibility in
              the faculty and students of the College of Arts and Sciences. By
              engaging in this community outreach, the participants not only
              helped the children but also gained a deeper appreciation for the
              importance of service and giving back to the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result of these combined efforts, the EXTENSION ACTIVITY: CAS
              AGAPE at Tiposu Elementary School was a tremendous success. Not
              only did it provide essential school supplies to students in need,
              but it also brought joy and encouragement to help them stay
              motivated in their studies. Under the leadership of Dean Princess
              Quintana, the College of Arts and Sciences reaffirmed its
              dedication to social responsibility and community engagement,
              emphasizing the importance of supporting others, especially during
              the holiday season.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, the event highlighted how even small acts of
              kindness can have a significant impact on the lives of others.
              Looking forward, the College of Arts and Sciences remains
              committed to continuing such outreach initiatives, striving to
              uplift and support the most vulnerable members of the community.

              Urdaneta City University (UCU) demonstrates its commitment to
              supporting students and the local community in building
              financially and socially sustainable businesses through the Center
              for Student Leadership and Development (CSLD). One of the core
              mandates of the CSLD is to create economic and entrepreneurial
              programs designed to empower students with the practical knowledge
              and skills essential for navigating the world of business and
              trade. This initiative not only helps students acquire a
              foundational understanding of entrepreneurship but also equips
              them to manage and generate their own financial
              resources—resources that can significantly enhance their academic
              and co-curricular experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              To fulfill this mandate, the CSLD has launched a pilot project for
              the Campus Student Organizations' Trade Fair, an innovative
              approach aimed at encouraging campus-based entrepreneurial
              ventures. This fair provides accredited Campus Student
              Organizations (CSOs) with a platform to showcase their products
              and services, gaining hands-on experience in running a business.
              By participating in this Trade Fair, CSOs are empowered to
              generate income that can fund their future activities, enabling
              them to carry out meaningful programs aligned with their vision,
              mission, goals, and objectives (VMGOs).
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond creating financial opportunities for students, this
              initiative supports the university's larger goal of fostering a
              supportive campus community. The trade fair and other
              entrepreneurial programs initiated by the CSLD connect students
              with resources, such as mentorship programs, training workshops,
              and access to university facilities. Through these resources, UCU
              not only facilitates the immediate needs of student organizations
              but also prepares students to launch and sustain their own
              ventures beyond their university experience, bridging the gap
              between academia and real-world entrepreneurship.
            </p>

            <p>
              By providing platforms like the Trade Fair and other
              entrepreneurial support, UCU exemplifies how a university can play
              an integral role in community development and in cultivating
              students' potential as future business leaders. This program
              illustrates UCU's dedication to fostering an environment that
              makes student life enjoyable, fulfilling, and meaningful,
              empowering students to contribute economically and socially within
              their communities.

              <p>
                Urdaneta City University (UCU) has officially launched a series
                of extension programs aimed at addressing poverty in the region.
                This new initiative, which focuses on empowering local
                communities through educational support, is a collaborative
                effort between UCU, local schools, and barangays (villages). The
                program is part of the university's commitment to supporting the
                local government's ongoing efforts to eradicate poverty and
                contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal
                of ending poverty in all its forms by 2030. In this way, UCU is
                reinforcing its role as a key partner in the fight against
                poverty, aligned with both local and global goals.
              </p>

              <p>
                The official launch of the program was marked by the signing of
                a Memorandum of Agreement led by UCU's Extension Director, Jerry
                Dichoso, who played a pivotal role in forging partnerships
                between the university, local schools, and barangays. The event,
                held at the respective campuses of the partner schools and
                barangays, saw the signing of Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with
                several barangay councils and schools in the region, formalizing
                their commitment to work together in delivering the program's
                objectives. As a result, the partnerships were solidified,
                creating a clear framework for collaboration and ensuring that
                the program would reach its intended beneficiaries.
              </p>

              <p>
                Furthermore, the partnership signing marked the beginning of a
                strong and meaningful collaboration that brought much-needed
                support to local communities. "Through this collective effort,
                we aimed to create a ripple effect that would empower local
                residents, enhance their skills, and provide them with the
                knowledge they needed to improve their lives and break free from
                the cycle of poverty," said Dichoso. "This was more than just a
                project; it was a movement for positive change." Thus, the
                initiative goes beyond immediate assistance, fostering long-term
                empowerment and self-sufficiency within the community.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, the partnership between UCU, local schools,
                barangays, and the local government is an example of how
                education can be leveraged as a powerful tool for social change.
                UCU's extension program is a concrete step toward achieving a
                poverty-free future, aligning with the Philippine government's
                national development goals and the global mandate to eradicate
                poverty. By working together, these entities are amplifying the
                impact of the program and contributing to broader social
                transformation efforts. Looking ahead, UCU plans to expand the
                program to include additional barangays and schools, reaching
                even more marginalized communities. The university is also
                exploring opportunities to collaborate with NGOs, business
                organizations, and other stakeholders to enhance the impact of
                the program. As a result, the university is laying the
                groundwork for a sustained and far-reaching effort that will
                continue to benefit local communities for years to come.

                  support sustainable business initiatives with the launch of a
                  Livelihood Training Program on Mushroom Production, held on
                  September 15, 2019. The program, organized by the Center for
                  Community Development and Extension Services (CCDES) under the
                  leadership of Dr. Mary Ruth Cinchez, aims to provide
                  participants with the practical skills needed to start their
                  own mushroom farming businesses while promoting sustainable
                  agricultural practices. In partnership with the Provincial
                  Agriculture Office, represented by Mdm. Concordia S. Lee, the
                  training focused on both the technical aspects of mushroom
                  production and the entrepreneurial strategies needed to
                  establish a viable, long-term business. Mdm. Lee, who served
                  as the lead trainer, guided the participants through key
                  processes such as cultivation, harvesting, and the economic
                  potential of mushroom farming as a sustainable business
                  venture.

                  The event was held at UCU's Audio Visual Room and saw strong
                  participation from various members of the university
                  community, including Deans, Department Heads, faculty, and
                  students. The program is part of UCU's broader vision to
                  empower individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to
                  launch start-up businesses that contribute to the local
                  economy and promote environmental sustainability.
