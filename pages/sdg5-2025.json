              "To further improve and expand the impact of the Human/Gender Rights Festival (FIESTA), several recommendations are proposed. First, it is encouraged to extend the duration of the festival or organize it as a series of events throughout the academic year to allow deeper engagement and broader participation. Second, the inclusion of more diverse speakers and panelists, especially those with lived experiences related to gender and human rights issues, would enrich the discussions and inspire greater empathy and understanding. Third, collaborating with more external organizations, such as local NGOs, advocacy groups, and public institutions, can enhance resources, increase visibility, and support SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Additionally, incorporating feedback mechanisms like post-event surveys or reflection sessions would help assess the event’s impact and identify areas for growth. Lastly, developing and distributing educational materials and toolkits after the festival can help participants apply what they’ve learned in their communities and sustain advocacy beyond the event. These improvements can strengthen FIESTA’s role as a transformative and inclusive platform for advancing gender equality and human rights."

          "The GENDER project reinforces Urdaneta City University’s commitment to human and gender rights by fostering a culture of equality, diversity, and empowerment among students, faculty, and partner communities.

Recognizing this, the GENDER: Guiding Equality, Nurturing Diversity, Empowering Rights project addresses these challenges by providing a platform for education, empowerment, and sustained advocacy through workshops, mentorship, and awareness campaigns. It aims to equip participants with knowledge of their rights, strategies to promote equality, and ongoing support via a mentoring network, cultivating respect, inclusion, and gender sensitivity within UCU and the broader community. By engaging students, educators, community leaders, and human rights advocates, this initiative strives to shape a more just and equal society through continuous learning and active advocacy."

Providing pre-session materials or short primers could also help participants come better prepared and more engaged. Additionally, incorporating more real-life case studies and local gender-related issues would make the content even more relevant and relatable to participants. To ensure continuity, the mentorship component could be expanded into a longer-term structured program with periodic check-ins and collaborative projects. Establishing an online platform or forum for participants and mentors would help sustain connections and support ongoing advocacy work. Lastly, future iterations of the program could include follow-up evaluations or mini-projects to assess the practical application of learning and track the long-term outcomes of participants’ involvement. These improvements would further strengthen the program’s effectiveness in building a gender-sensitive and rights-aware academic and community environment."
