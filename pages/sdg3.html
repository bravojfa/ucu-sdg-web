            Health is a fundamental human right, yet many individuals lack
            access to essential healthcare services. This goal aims to reduce
            maternal and child mortality, combat communicable diseases, and
            promote mental health awareness. It advocates for universal access
            to quality healthcare services, ensuring that all individuals can
            lead healthy lives. Urdaneta City University prioritizes the health
            and well-being of its students by providing comprehensive mental
            health services, including counseling and wellness programs. The
            University organizes health awareness campaigns and workshops that
            promote physical fitness and mental resilience, fostering a
            supportive environment for overall well-being.

            <p>
              In a progressive step towards inclusive and comprehensive
              education on sexual and reproductive health, the Midwifery Program
              of Urdaneta City University (UCU) has introduced a dynamic course
              on Gender and Society that equips students with essential
              knowledge on gender equality, sexual health, and reproductive
              rights. This initiative, a first of its kind in the region, seeks
              to empower future midwives with skills and insights to provide
              more empathetic and informed health care to diverse communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course covers a wide array of critical topics, including
              family planning, maternal health, sexually transmitted infections
              (STIs), and the importance of accessible reproductive health
              services. The UCU Midwifery Program recognizes that midwives often
              serve as the primary touchpoint for reproductive health in many
              communities, making it essential for students to have a nuanced
              understanding of gender sensitivities and patient-centered care.
