            Health is a fundamental human right, yet many individuals lack
            access to essential healthcare services. This goal aims to reduce
            maternal and child mortality, combat communicable diseases, and
            promote mental health awareness. It advocates for universal access
            to quality healthcare services, ensuring that all individuals can
            lead healthy lives. Urdaneta City University prioritizes the health
            and well-being of its students by providing comprehensive mental
            health services, including counseling and wellness programs. The
            University organizes health awareness campaigns and workshops that
            promote physical fitness and mental resilience, fostering a
            supportive environment for overall well-being.

              <p>
                In a progressive step towards inclusive and comprehensive
                education on sexual and reproductive health, the Midwifery
                Program of Urdaneta City University (UCU) has introduced a
                dynamic course on Gender and Society that equips students with
                essential knowledge on gender equality, sexual health, and
                reproductive rights. This initiative, a first of its kind in the
                region, seeks to empower future midwives with skills and
                insights to provide more empathetic and informed health care to
                diverse communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The course covers a wide array of critical topics, including
                family planning, maternal health, sexually transmitted
                infections (STIs), and the importance of accessible reproductive
                health services. The UCU Midwifery Program recognizes that
                midwives often serve as the primary touchpoint for reproductive
                health in many communities, making it essential for students to
                have a nuanced understanding of gender sensitivities and
                patient-centered care.
