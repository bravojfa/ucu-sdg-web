          "The External Affairs and Linkages Department of Urdaneta City University proudly participated in the \"Kalinga sa UCU Grand Medical Mission\" a large-scale healthcare initiative organized by the Kalinga Partylist. This event was conceived as a response to the persistent need for accessible healthcare services among underserved communities in and around Urdaneta City. The medical mission reflects a shared commitment between the university, government agencies, and civic organizations to uphold public welfare through responsive and inclusive service delivery. Recognizing the university’s integral role in community development, the department saw this initiative as an opportunity to extend its impact beyond academic boundaries and contribute meaningfully to addressing pressing societal issues. The activity formed part of the university’s broader agenda to promote social responsibility, foster institutional partnerships, and reinforce its role as a key stakeholder in public service."

          "The medical mission contributed significantly to several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Foremost among these is SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), which advocates for ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. By offering free consultations, medications, and other essential health services, the mission addressed health inequalities and reduced barriers to medical access for vulnerable sectors. Additionally, the initiative supported SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by reaching out to marginalized populations, thereby promoting inclusivity in healthcare provision. SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) was also central to the event, as the mission was a product of collaboration among government bodies, the academic sector, and civil society—demonstrating how collective action can lead to meaningful and measurable social impact. The event also resonated with the university’s commitment to civic engagement, sustainability, and cross-sector collaboration."

              "To build on the momentum of this successful initiative, it is recommended that the External Affairs and Linkages Department institutionalize its involvement in similar outreach missions as part of its regular program of activities. Future events could benefit from the inclusion of more comprehensive services such as dental check-ups, mental health consultations, and health education sessions focused on nutrition, hygiene, and disease prevention. Expanding the scope and reach of these programs to nearby rural areas can help broaden the impact of the university’s outreach efforts. The department should also consider forming a standing committee on community health initiatives, composed of representatives from various university departments and partner organizations, to ensure continuous planning and program development. Furthermore, increasing the involvement of students—particularly those in health sciences, social work, and public administration—can provide valuable experiential learning while reinforcing the university’s role in developing civic-minded graduates. Finally, improved data collection and post-event evaluation mechanisms should be implemented to better measure outcomes, gather community feedback, and guide improvements for future outreach initiatives."

Monitoring the impact of the collaboration is also essential; this can be achieved by developing simple metrics such as incident reports, seminar attendance, and student feedback to evaluate effectiveness and inform continuous improvement. Broadening participation across the university is encouraged by involving student organizations and various academic departments to integrate safety and peace-building themes into both curricular and co-curricular programs. Communicating the success of joint initiatives through campus media and local press will help build public trust, promote transparency, and inspire broader community support. Lastly, seeking complementary partners—such as local NGOs or health agencies—can expand the scope of the collaboration to include mental health support, disaster preparedness, and other community resilience efforts, thereby amplifying the overall impact of the MOA."
