          Gender equality is essential for sustainable development, as it
          benefits societies, economies, and communities as a whole. This goal
          aims to eliminate discrimination and violence against all individuals,
          promoting equal opportunities in leadership, education, and economic
          participation, regardless of gender identity. By fostering an
          inclusive environment, we can create a society where everyone has the
          chance to thrive. Urdaneta City University actively champions gender
          equality and empowerment for all through initiatives that promote
          diverse leadership within the student body and faculty. The University
          organizes events and workshops that address a wide range of gender
          issues, creating safe spaces for open dialogue and discussion. By
          empowering students to advocate for equal rights and opportunities,
          UCU fosters an inclusive community where all individuals are
          encouraged to contribute to positive change. Through mentorship
          programs and support networks, UCU ensures that every student,
          regardless of gender, can pursue their aspirations and lead with
          confidence.

                Urdaneta City, Philippines — Urdaneta City University (UCU) has
                implemented a systematic approach to track and analyze women’s
                application and acceptance rates in admissions. This initiative,
                led by UCU’s Admissions department, gathers demographic data to
                evaluate gender equity and drive data-informed policies for a
                more inclusive student body.
              </p>
              <p>
                This allows UCU to collect real-time data on the percentage of
                female applicants and their acceptance rates, providing valuable
                insights into gender representation within the student body. By
                monitoring these metrics, UCU can make informed decisions to
                enhance outreach and support efforts that encourage more women
                to apply and thrive at the university. “At UCU, we aim to create
                an environment where every student, regardless of gender, has
                equal access to education and opportunities.

                Urdaneta City, Philippines — Urdaneta City University (UCU) has

                underrepresented, such as criminology, engineering, information
                technology, and certain areas within the sciences. This
                initiative reflects UCU’s commitment to promoting diversity in
                all fields of study and supporting women in exploring a wider
                range of academic and career opportunities.

                education. By challenging gender norms in academia and
                encouraging more women to pursue diverse fields, UCU is not only
                enriching its own academic community but also preparing a new
                generation of women to lead and innovate in their chosen
                professions. As the university continues to expand this
                initiative, it hopes to inspire lasting change and serve as a

                diversity in higher education.
