Incorporating follow-up activities such as online orientations, regular progress updates, or virtual check-ins can help sustain engagement and ensure continued clarity throughout the program’s implementation. It is also suggested to diversify the pool of speakers and facilitators to include voices from partner agencies, local government units, and former program beneficiaries, offering broader and more relatable perspectives.
