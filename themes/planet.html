                integration—to allow participants to explore topics in greater
                depth and engage in more hands-on activities. Providing
                pre-event reading materials or guidelines on international
                rankings and best practices could help participants arrive
                better prepared and more engaged. Additionally, incorporating
                more practical case studies, particularly those relevant to the
                university’s current initiatives, would make the discussions
                more grounded and actionable. To support the continuity of
                learning, the program could introduce follow-up workshops or
                online forums where participants can share progress and exchange
                ideas on implementing strategies learned during the event.
                Establishing a mentorship component involving experienced
                university leaders or external experts in internationalization
                could further strengthen participants’ skills and confidence.
                Lastly, future iterations could include evaluation mechanisms
                such as pre- and post-event surveys or mini-projects that track
                participants’ application of knowledge and contributions to the
                university’s global ranking efforts. These recommendations would
                help solidify the program’s role in driving sustainable
                internationalization and institutional excellence.
